# dpstudios blog

This is the code of my blog, where I'll post some random things about programming.

## Build

The blog is write using JBake so for build it, just need to run:

```
jbake -b
```

If you want to launch a local server to test it while modify things run:

```
jbake -b -s
```

## Deploy

For deploy, just push the code to master. (It's not the best but I think that is more than enough for my blog :joy:)
